# React MovieDB Frontend

This project is a React-based web application built with Vite and TailwindCSS that leverages [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org) to search, filter, and display movie information. It provides a modern UI for browsing movies based on search queries, selected genres, and popular titles.
